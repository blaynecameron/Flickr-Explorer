#Flickr Explorer - Blayne Chong#

An Udacity project that I decided to recreate for some practice. Users can add pins to a map and select those pins to view flickr photos that people took at those locations which are displayed in a collection view.

It makes use of core data, to persist pins to the map. I have also included two podfiles, Afnetworking and SDWebImage to take care of the networking side of the app.
